# Agent Instructions
- **Do not run the test suite locally.** GitHub Actions executes all tests automatically. Try to have tests for all features. Try to keep features as small as possible while still providing meaningful value.
- Add or update tests directly in the repositoryâ€”CI will run them whenever a pull request is opened.
- Avoid invoking test runners or integration scripts during local development unless for your own exploration.
- Each viable feature should be documented in the features list section in the README.md and have a matching test with the same name and a direct link to that test file.
